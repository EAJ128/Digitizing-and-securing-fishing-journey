# Digitizing-and-securing-fishing-journey
There is no proper platform for direct money donations to fishermen during natural disasters or crises, ensuring timely support and relief.                                                            Post-catch wastage is high due to lack of storage, logistics, and buyer Fishermen lack access to real-time weather alerts, putting their lives at risk.
